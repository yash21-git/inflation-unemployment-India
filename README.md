# Inflation-Unemployment Chronicles — India’s Economic Timeline
Applied econometric analysis of India’s inflation (1960–2024) and unemployment (1991–2024) using Python in Google Colab. Includes EDA, statistical tests, AR/ARIMA/VAR models, forecasts, and real-world event insights with annotated visualizations.

# Project Overview
This project analyses the historical trends of inflation (1960–2024) and unemployment (1991–2024) in India using time series modeling and statistical techniques.It combines exploratory data analysis, model fitting (AR, ARIMA, VAR), and real-world event interpretation to explain economic fluctuations.

# Objectives
1.) Visualize long-term inflation & unemployment trends.
2.) Test for stationarity and identify autocorrelation patterns.
3.) Build AR(1), ARIMA, and VAR models for forecasting.
4.) Link data spikes/drops to historical economic events.

# Tools & Technologies
Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Statsmodels, NumPy)
Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab
Statistical modeling & diagnostics

# Skills Demonstrated
1.) Data Cleaning & Preparation (structuring time series data)
2. ) Data Visualization (annotated line plots, ACF/PACF)
3.) Statistical Analysis (ADF stationarity tests, autocorrelation)

4.) Time Series Modeling:
   a.) Autoregressive models (AR)
   b.) ARIMA forecasting
   c.) Vector Autoregression (VAR)

5.) Interpretation & Storytelling:
    a.) Connecting trends to real-world events like:
    b.) 1974 Oil Shock (inflation spike)
    c.) 1991 Balance-of-Payments Crisis (inflation surge)
    d.) 2020 COVID-19 Pandemic (unemployment spike)

# Real-World Insights

1.) 1974 Inflation Spike (28.6%) — First Oil Shock (OAPEC embargo) → fuel price surge → inflation rise.

2.) 1976 Negative Inflation (-7.6%) — Commodity price drop & base effect post-oil crisis.

3.) 1991 Inflation Surge (13.9%) — Balance-of-payments crisis, rupee devaluation, IMF reforms.

4.) 2020–21 Unemployment Spike — COVID-19 lockdowns, job losses, slow recovery.
